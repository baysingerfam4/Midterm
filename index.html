        <p>The National Interagency Fire Center statistics show that as of April 26, 11,523 fires this year have burned more than 1.8 million acres. March 2024 saw 3,809 fires burning more than 1,400,000 acres. While the number of fire incidents was just above the average of 3,471, the acres burned was the most on record given the 2001-2020 average was approximately 116,300 acres. 
            In the U.S., the National Significant Wildland Fire Potential Outlook, the National Interagency Fire Center's monthly report, details weather, drought conditions, past incidents and potential risk.
            In recent months, there was increased fire activity in the Central Plains, Eastern, Southern and Rocky Mountains, but it subsided following timely precipitation. However, fire activity increased in the central Appalachians, with large fire complex's in Virginia and West Virginia.
            The outlook shows above-normal significant wildfire potential in Hawaii and across the Midwest and Southwest regions between April and July 2024. California's wildfire season runs between April and October, when the weather is warmer and dry. Based on the outlook, much of California remains below-normal wildfire potential well into July. Temperatures are expected to be above normal for much of the U.S., including Alaska.</p>

                The biggest impact of wildfires is families that may be displaced from losing their home and may not have the proper insurance or funds to rebuild. Some who live outside may have more health problems due to smoke inhalation. Then some low income individuals may not have access to an air conditioner and by opening a window they are exposed to smoke. High heat and wild fires can also affect agriculture. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: “Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States during the last two decades.

                <p>Computer programmers and software developers can assist satellites and thermal imaging to detect wildfires and develop software for that detection. And help develop software to inform the public about incoming wildfires and use prevention measure to help keep it at bay.
                    Programmers and developers can also create a website to inform and educate the public how to not only prevent fires but also how to protect your property in case of a fire. Along with emergency preparedness information. Programmers can also assist AI in fire prevention technology.</p>
